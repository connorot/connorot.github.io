            <section class="section">
            <p>My name is Connor O'Sullivan, and I am currently serving as a Computer Lab Assistant at Waubonsee Community College, where I am also pursuing an Associate's degree in Computer Support. My passion lies in the preservation of retro games, a fascination that drives my academic and personal pursuits. I am particularly drawn to the Internet Archive, a vital platform recognized by the U.S. Congress for its role in preserving lost media, including vintage games and books. This site embodies the importance of safeguarding digital content from corporate neglect.
            At home, my world revolves around Candy, my delightful yet eccentric dog, who brings joy and chaos in equal measure. I firmly believe in the right to emulate video games that are no longer accessible, advocating for digital preservation as a means to honor and maintain our cultural heritage.
            As I continue on this academic and professional journey, I am eager to apply the skills I acquire to contribute meaningfully to the preservation of digital artifacts, ensuring that future generations can enjoy and learn from the past.</p>
